# One-to-One and One-to-Many Relationships

## Learning Goals

- Use SQLAlchemy to join tables with one-to-one, one-to-many, and
  many-to-many relationships.

***

## Introduction

We already know that we can build our SQL tables such that they associate with
one another via **primary keys** and **foreign keys**. We can also use
SQLAlchemy to access data across different tables by establishing relationships
in code, without having to write tons of code ourselves, following the idea of
**convention over configuration**.

SQLAlchemy relationships make it easy to establish relationships between our
models, without having to write a ton of SQL ourselves. Sounds great, right? Now
that we have you totally hooked, let's take a look at how we use these SQLAlchemy
relationships.

Before we begin, run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` to generate and enter
your virtual environment. This will install `sqlalchemy`, `alembic`, `faker`,
`pytest`, and `ipdb`.

***

## How do we use SQLAlchemy Relationships?

SQLAlchemy ORM uses a `ForeignKey` column to constrain and join data models,
as well as a `relationship()` method that provides a property to one model
that can be used to access its related model. SQLAlchemy ORM also uses a
`backref()` method to create the property in the related model. This makes the
syntax for accessing related models and creating join tables very simple.

### One-to-Many Example

Here is some code that you might use to create a relationship between an order
and a customer:

```py
# imports, base

class Customer(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'customers'

    customer_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)

    orders = relationship('Order', backref='customer')


class Order(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders'

    order_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    customer_id = Column(Integer(), ForeignKey('customers.customer_id'))
```

We can see that the `Customer` model contains an `orders` class attribute
that is set by the `relationship()` method. The `backref()` method therein
sets the reverse many-to-one relationship that **ref**ers **back** from the
`Order` model. Inclusion of a foreign key for a `Customer` instance in the
`Order` model is all that is needed to complete this relationship.

(If you don't need think you'll need the many-to-one relationship, you can
leave out the `backref`.)

### One-to-One Example

One-to-one relationships aren't _tremendously_ common, but they're simple
to build in SQLAlchemy ORM if you ever need to!

Let's say that orders have a lot of important associated data, but only two
or three columns' worth of regularly-queried data. In designing a database to
return data quickly, it makes the most sense for us to separate the important
attributes into a smaller table and create a one-to-one relationship with the
beefier database for metadata.

```py
# imports, base

class Order(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders'

    order_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)

class OrderMetadata(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'orders_metadata'

    order_metadata_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    order_id = Column(Integer(), ForeignKey("order.order_id"))
    
    order = relationship('Order',
        backref=backref('order_metadata', uselist=False))
```

The syntax for a one-to-one relationship is identical to that of a one-to-many
relationship, with the exception that the `backref()` method takes
`uselist=False` as an optional second parameter. This means exactly what it
sounds like: the `Order` model refers back to the `OrderMetadata` model via a
property `order_metadata` that is not a list. (If it were a list, it would be
many!)

## Overview

In this lesson, we'll be building out a **one-to-many** relationship between two
models: **games** and **reviews**. We'll set up our database so that a game
**has many** reviews, and each review **belongs to** a specific game.

By writing a few migrations and making use of the appropriate SQLAlchemy
methods, we'll be able to:

- ask a game about its reviews.
- ask a review about its game.

Here's what our Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) looks like:

***

## Building our Migrations

### The Game Model

A game will _have many_ reviews. Before we worry about the migration that will
implement this in our reviews table, let's think about what that table will look
like:

|  game_id  |     game_title     |  game_platform  |  game_platform   | game_price |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
|     1     | Breath of the Wild |      Switch     | Action-adventure |     60     |

Our games table doesn't need any information about the reviews, so it makes
sense to generate this table first: it doesn't have any dependencies on another
table. This makes sense even thinking about our domain in the real world: a game
can exist without any reviews.

The basic structure for your SQLAlchemy app is already configured. Navigate to
the `one_to_many` directory and you should see the following directory
structure:

```console
.
├── alembic.ini
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── db.py
└── migrations
    ├── README
    ├── env.py
    ├── script.py.mako
    └── versions
```

`alembic.ini` points to a SQLite database called `one_to_many.db`. The models
should go into `app/db.py`; it is already configured to create a `Base`, and
`env.py` is pointing to its metadata.

Navigate to `app/db.py` and build a basic model for the `games` table:

```py
# imports, base set up for you in app/db.py

class Game(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'games'

    game_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    game_title = Column(String())
    game_genre = Column(String())
    game_platform = Column(String())
    game_price = Column(Integer())
```

Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m'Create Game Model'` from inside of the
`one_to_many` directory. You should see the following output:

```console
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'games'
  Generating ...python-p3-sqlalchemy-one-to-many/one-to-many/migrations/versions/62797912f786_create_game_model.py ...  done
```

Run `alembic upgrade head` to generate a database with your `Game` model.

### The Review Model

A review will **belong to** a specific game. What does that mean in terms of our
database? Think back to what you learned about SQL and joining between multiple
tables. How can we connect between a review and its associated game?

That's right, we need a **foreign key**! Since a review belongs to a specific
game, we need some way of indicating on the review _which_ specific game it
belongs to.

Let's take a look at what our `reviews` table will need to look like:

| review_id  | review_score | review_comment | game_id |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------- |
|     1      |      10      |   A classic!   |    1    |

Ok! Now that we know what we need to create, let's head back to `app/db.py`
and write out a new model:

```py
class Review(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'reviews'

    review_id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    review_score = Column(Integer())
    review_comment = Column(String())
    game_id = Column(Integer(), ForeignKey('games.game_id'))
```

Make sure to add the relationship to `Game` as well:

```py
class Game(Base):
    ...
    reviews = relationship('Review', backref=backref('game'))
```

Lastly, don't forget to set the `__repr__` for each of your models. You''ll
thank me later!

```py
class Game(Base):
    ...
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Game(id={self.game_id}, ' + \
            f'title={self.game_title}, ' + \
            f'platform={self.game_platform})'

class Review(Base):
    ...
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Review(id={self.review_id}, ' + \
            f'score={self.score}, ' + \
            f'game_id={self.game_id})'
```

Great! Now go ahead and run the same commands in your terminal to generate
and run our migrations:

```console
$ alembic revision --autogenerate -m'Add Review Model'
# => INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
# => INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
# => INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'reviews'
# =>   Generating ...sqlalchemy-relationships/python-p3-sqlalchemy-one-to-many/one_to_many/migrations/versions/1f2ce6b5977d_add_review_model.py ...  done

$ alembic upgrade head
# => INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
# => INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
# => INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 62797912f786 -> 1f2ce6b5977d, Add Review Model
```

There is also some code in the `db/seeds.py` file that we'll use to generate
some data for our two models. In the seed file, we first create a game instance,
then use the ID from that game instance to associate it with the corresponding
review. The data itself is generated automatically using `faker`.

Run this to fill the database with games and reviews:

```console
$ python app/seed.py
```

## Exploring our Relationships Using SQLAlchemy

### A Review Belongs to a Game

Let's enter the Python shell and access the first review. Run `python
debug.py` to set up a session and import the data models:

```py
# Access the first review instance in the database
review = session.query(Review).first()
review
# => Review(id=1, score=7, game_id=1)

# Get the game_id foreign key for the review instance
review.game_id
# => 1
```

We know that this review has some relationship to data in the `games` table. We
could even use the foreign key to access that data directly:

```py
# Find a specific game instance using an ID
session.query(Game).filter_by(game_id=review.game_id).first()
# => Game(id=1, title=Jacob Floyd, platform=wii u)
```

But SQLAlchemy provides an even easier route to the related game:

```py
review.game
# => Game(id=1, title=Jacob Floyd, platform=wii u)
```

_Nice!_

### A Game Has Many Reviews

Now let's access the first game:

```py
game = session.query(Game).first()
game
# => Game(id=1, title=Jacob Floyd, platform=wii u)
```

As expected, this is the same game that we found through the first review. We
can search for reviews using this game's ID as a filter:

```py
reviews = session.query(Review).filter_by(game_id=game.game_id)
[review for review in reviews]
# => [Review(id=1, score=7, game_id=1), Review(id=2, score=7, game_id=1), Review(id=3, score=8, game_id=1)]
```

But just as with finding the game for a review, we can access a game's reviews
directly using its relationship:

```py
game.reviews
# => [Review(id=1, score=7, game_id=1), Review(id=2, score=7, game_id=1), Review(id=3, score=8, game_id=1)]
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we explored the most common kind of relationship between two
models: the **one-to-many** or "has-many"/"belongs-to" relationship. With a
solid understanding of how to connect databases using primary and foreign keys,
we can take advantage of some helpful SQLAlchemy methods that make it much
easier to build comprehensive database schemas and integrate them into our
Python applications.

Run `pytest -x` to make sure all of the tests are passing. In the next lesson,
we'll explore many-to-many relationships in SQLAlchemy
